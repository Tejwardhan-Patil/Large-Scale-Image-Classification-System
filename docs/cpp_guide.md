# C++ Guide

## Overview

Certain components of the system are implemented in C++ to enhance performance, particularly for large-scale data processing and model inference.

## Data Augmentation in C++

Data augmentation tasks, such as rotation and flipping, are implemented in C++ for performance reasons.

- File: `data/scripts/cpp_augment.cpp`

## Data Preprocessing in C++

Image preprocessing tasks are optimized using C++.

- File: `data/scripts/cpp_preprocess.cpp`

## Custom Neural Network Layers

Custom layers used in model architectures are implemented in C++.

- File: `models/architectures/custom_layer.cpp`

## High-Performance Inference

To support real-time applications, inference tasks are implemented in C++.

- File: `models/inference/cpp_inference.cpp`

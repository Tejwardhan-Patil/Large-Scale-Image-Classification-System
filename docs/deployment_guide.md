# Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers deploying the trained model to cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP using Docker for containerization.

## Docker Setup

To containerize the model for deployment, Docker is used.

- File: `deployment/docker/Dockerfile`
- Key Features:
  - Python runtime with necessary dependencies
  - Pre-trained model mounted at `/models/`

Use `docker-compose.yml` for orchestrating multi-container setups:

- File: `deployment/docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Services:
  - Model inference service
  - Monitoring service

## AWS Deployment

To deploy on AWS, use the provided script.

- File: `deployment/scripts/deploy_aws.py`
- Features:
  - Deploys Docker container to AWS ECS
  - Auto-scaling enabled

## Google Cloud Deployment

For Google Cloud, use the GCP deployment script.

- File: `deployment/scripts/deploy_gcp.py`
- Features:
  - Deploys to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
  - GCP-specific optimizations

## API Deployment

The model is served using a REST API.

- File: `deployment/api/app.py`
- Framework: Flask or FastAPI
- API Endpoints:
  - `/predict`: Takes an image and returns classification results.
  - `/health`: Health check for the API service.

A C++ backend is also available for high-performance applications.

- File: `deployment/api/cpp_backend.cpp`

# Large-Scale Image Classification System

## Overview

This project is an Image Classification System designed to use both Python and C++ for efficient and scalable image processing and classification tasks. The system integrates various machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a focus on performance optimization for real-time applications. The architecture is modular, ensuring easy customization and extension to suit specific use cases such as transfer learning, custom model layers, and deployment in production environments.

The project is structured to support high-performance computing needs, with C++ components handling critical tasks that require low latency and high throughput. Python is used for tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and deployment, providing a balance between development speed and execution efficiency.

## Features

- **Data Management**:
  - Organized structure for raw and processed image data, with annotations for easy access and use in training.
  - Python scripts for image preprocessing, augmentation, and data splitting, ensuring data is ready for model training.
  - C++ scripts for performance-critical tasks in data augmentation and preprocessing, optimized for large datasets.

- **Model Development**:
  - Multiple model architectures implemented in Python, including CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet.
  - Custom layers and performance-critical components implemented in C++ to enhance model efficiency.
  - Support for pretrained models and the ability to create custom models tailored to specific datasets.

- **Experimentation and Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Configurable experiment setup with Python scripts to manage various configurations and automate hyperparameter tuning.
  - Logs and metrics collection for each experiment, enabling detailed analysis and comparison of model performance.

- **Deployment**:
  - Dockerized deployment process to ensure consistency across environments.
  - Python scripts for deploying models on cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
  - REST API for serving models in production, with a C++ backend for handling low-latency requests and ensuring high performance.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
  - Logging and monitoring tools to track model performance and operational metrics over time.
  - Integration with MLOps tools for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), ensuring that models are always up to date and performing optimally.

- **Utilities and Helpers**:
  - A suite of utility scripts in Python for data loading, metrics evaluation, and visualization.
  - C++ utilities for performance optimization and data manipulation tasks, ensuring that the system can handle large-scale data efficiently.

- **Testing**:
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests for both Python and C++ components, ensuring robustness and reliability of the system.
  - Automated testing workflows integrated with CI/CD pipelines to maintain code quality.

- **Documentation**:
  - Detailed documentation covering model architectures, data pipeline, deployment steps, API usage, and the C++ components used in the project.
  - Step-by-step guides for new users to set up and deploy the system in different environments.
